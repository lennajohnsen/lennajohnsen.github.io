          <p class="lead"> Historically the United States has led the world in refugee admissions, resettling an estimated third-to-half of the world’s refugees since World War II. 
            However the Trump administration has changed that. For the first time the U.S. has resettled fewer refugees than the rest of the world. 
            Given President Trump’s discriminatory rhetoric towards members of the Islamic faith, this decrease in refugees appears to particularly disadvantage refugees from Muslim-majority countries.</p>

          <h2>The Process</h2>
          <p class="lead"> Admission as a refugee is the most challenging way for someone to enter the United States. To be placed in the United States, a refugee must go through a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/29/us/refugee-vetting-process.html">20 step vetting process</a> that involves screening from the United Nations and multiple U.S. federal agencies. 
            The process from application to resettlement takes at a minimum eighteen months, but can stretch up to three years. <br />

            <br>
            The settlement process is largely controlled by the presidency. Since 1980 when the policy was adopted, every year in October the Executive Branch sets a cap or “ceiling” to set an upper-limit of refugees admitted into the United States in the next fiscal, which historically averaged 96,000. 
            The actual number of refugees settled in the U.S. often falls short of the cap. In response to the Syrian Civil War and the growing refugee crisis across the globe, the Obama administration increased the refugee cap from 85,000 in FY 2016 to 110,000 in FY 2017.

            <p class="lead">
            One of the first policy decisions made by the Trump administration was to halt refugees settlement in the United States. On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, commonly known as the Muslim Ban, which, in addition to barring entry from seven Muslim-majority nations, 
            imposed a 120-day ban on refugees entering the U.S.. While the courts intervened to portions of the ban, in October, 2017 the administration passed new vetting policies that further slowed down resettlement processes and imposed a new 90-day ban on 11 countries, nice of whom are majority-Muslim. 
            These actions resulted in a dramatic slowdown in refugee resettlement. Despite the 110,000 ceiling in 2017, the United States only resettled 53,716 refugees. In 2018, the Trump administration further reduced the cap to a nearly 40-year low of 45,000, and, over the course of the year, resettled less 
            than half of that target (22,491). In 2019, the Trump Administration announced it would further reduce the cap to 30,000 refugees and, as of May 2019,<a href="http://www.wrapsnet.org/admissions-and-arrivals"> is well short of reaching that limit.</a>

          <h2>Countries of Origin</h2>
          <p class="lead">While the Trump administration’s policy change has decreased refugee admissions across nationality, the change in policy has disproportionately 
            impacted refugees from Muslim-majority nations. Refugees from Muslim-majority nations made up 47% of total refugees resettled in the United States in 2016. 
            In 2018 that share had fallen to just 9%.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The number of Somali refugees fell from 9,020 in 2016 to 267 in 2018.</li>
              <li>The number of Iraqi refugees fell from 9,880 in 2016 to just 140 in 2018.</li> 
              <li>The number of Syrian refugees fell from 12,587 in 2016 to just 62 in 2018. </li>
            </ul>   
            <p class="lead"> The policy change has had varying impacts across the country. Michigan, for example, went from having 3,042 refugee come from Muslim-majority nations  
              (71% of total) to just 86 in 2018 (13% of total). In Texas, the number fell from 3,578 in 2016 (46% of total) to just 149 (9% of total). In 2016, 75% of states had at 
              least a third of their refugees coming from Muslim-majority nations. By 2018, no state had at least a third of their refugees coming from a Muslim-majority nation. 
              Additionally, 8 states and DC had no refugees from Muslim-majority nation settled in their jurisdiction. </p>

          <h2>Services we offer</h2>
          <p class="lead">Misinformation has driven many negative conceptions about refugees, particularly those coming from Muslim-majority nations. However, emerging research is disproving these myths. A recent report from Stanford University’s Immigration Policy Lab indicates that reducing the number of refugees in a community does not reduce the crime rate. Research from the Center for American Progress find that refugees quickly become self-sufficient and, in the long-run, become well-integrated into society, having similar rates of labor force participation, wages and business ownership as their U.S. born neighbors. Rather than being a financial burden to the U.S., research found that between 2005 and 2013 refugees and asylees contributed $63 billion more in taxes than they used in public services.</p>
